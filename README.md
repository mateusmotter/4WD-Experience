## Website Project for a 4WD Tour Company

### Description

In this project I was asked to create a website for a fictional company, using flexbox in the CSS code.

I went beyond and made it a reponsive website, changing certain attributes in order to have it looking good both on a laptop/desktop screen and also in a mobile phone.

### Features

The website is contains the following attrubutes:

+ Fixed Header;
+ Destinations list becoming visible when hovering "DESTINATIONS" in the header section;
+ Clickable items have hovering attributes to advise clickability to users;
+ Flexbox used in the "Destinations" section (in order to facilitate view in smaller screens);
+ Grid used in the "Meet the Team" section to have it looking good in smaller screens;
+ Custom message if cursor rests on top of team members images;

### Technologies

This website was built on HTML and CSS using Visual Code Studio.

Thank you for taking the time to check my project :)
